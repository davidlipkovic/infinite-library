              “If a library can be something as simple as an organized collection of texts, then libraries massively pre-date books in the history of culture. Every country has a tradition of legends, parables, riddles, myths and chants that existed long before they were written down. Warehoused as memories, these texts passed from generation to generation through dance, gesture and word of mouth.”

                          Welcome to The Library of Shadows, a VR experience devoted to Togalu gombeyaata, an ancient art form and living folk tradition from South India, specifically Karnataka. Shadow puppetry originated in India and China around the 1st century BCE. As a medium, it plays with the two most primal elements in the universe, darkness and light, and prefigures all other mediums, such as cinematography and VR, which use light, images, and projection screens in creative ways.
                          <br><br>
                          For most of the contemporary human world, true darkness no longer exists. Your cities and homes are bathed in artificial light and you spend hours each day looking at backlit phones, computers, or television screens. Because of this, few of you can imagine how your ancestors once related to the dark. For them, shadows didn’t simply signify the absence of light, rather they belonged to a world which had presence, mystery, sometimes even intention. This included ghosts, spirits, and other beings from other realms.  Togalu gombeyaata  creates art out of the magical substance of shadows: puppeteers bring characters to life, making them walk, dance, fight, and laugh, while music and narration accompany them.
                          <br><br>
                          The Library of Shadows shares four puppets from Samudra Manthan, a popular Hindu epic that tells the story of the eternal struggle between the gods (devas) and demons (asuras). The gods, having lost their power, ask the demons to help them obtain an elixir of immortality (Amrita), so as to regain their powers. To do so, the gods and demons must work with a large snake named Vasuki to churn a cosmic ocean of milk. In the process, treasures bubble to the surface, including a wish-fulfilling cow named Kamadhenu, a four tusked elephant named Airavata, and a winged horse named Uchchaihshravas. While the gods eventually obtain the elixir, the demons also get a small portion, which is why the struggle between good and evil remains till this day.

                        <h2 class="uppercase colorGreyGreen">Indian Shadow Puppet Theatre</h2><br>
                        <p class="colorGreyGreen">
                          There is an ancient Greek story where the gods were debating about where to hide the greatest secret to life, the ultimate wisdom. Some suggested the highest mountain, but others argued that humans would eventually climb it, some then suggested the deepest ocean but that was rejected. Eventually humans would reach there too. Finally the gods decided to hide it in plain sight,   within   the   human’s   own   mind--his   dreams.   I   believe,   that   epic narratives are also where the gods placed this wisdom.
                          <br><br>
                          The   traditional   puppet   theatre   is   characterized   by   such   narratives   being passed down from one generation to the next within the family or kin over a few   hundred   or   even   a   few   thousand   years.   Each   generation   then   adds something   of   their   own   and   passes   it   on,   further   distilling,   refining   and adapting   it   to   changing   audiences   and   patrons.   Thus   tradition   is   an   ever changing   phenomenon,   it   is   not   something   frozen   in   time.   The   day   it becomes static, it starts to die. Traditional performing art forms are very importantly rooted in their cultural history,   social   practices   and   linguistic   contexts.   These   are   complex   and nuanced biospheres. The evolution of Shadow puppetry and the role of the puppeteer in India is a living testimonial of this complexity.
                          <br><br>
                          Traditional puppetry in India is not of a single type. There are (on record) 18 living forms which include glove, rod, string and shadow puppets in different parts   of  India.   Besides   these,  there  are several  new  groups  of   puppeteers who are not generational puppeteers and work with an amalgam of old and new techniques. They are called somewhat debatably “modern” puppeteers. The situation of the puppet forms vary widely from region to region in India.
                          <br><br>
                          The  most important   aspect  of  traditional   puppetry  is   its  narrative  context, which is deeply rooted in the oral versions of epics like the Ramayana and the   Mahabharata   ,   stories   from   the   Puranas   and   regional   folklore.   These narratives determine the nature of the performances (dialogues, stylizations in speech, in music and songs) the design of the puppets (color, shape, size, material used), the aesthetic of the form and its link with the audience. The story  is  thus  the core and the puppets  mostly illustrate the narrative. The aesthetic often resembles  that of  the local sculptures, paintings  and other performing   arts.   These   are   inextricably   linked.   Traditional   audiences   are already familiar with the story, the songs, dialogues and jokes too. The role of the puppeteer was and still is more than that of a mere entertainer. S/he is the Shaman, healer, storyteller, local wise wo/man, the holder of a collective
                          <br><br>
                          history,   drawing   parallels   between   the   local   politics   and   the   epics,   linking philosophy and social realities. His/her deep knowledge of the oral narrative on the  one  hand and  socio-cultural realities  on the  other helps  him/her to negotiate the space between the audience and the mythical characters. In my opinion it is him/her, the carrier of the narrative, and not the puppets, that are central to the performance.
                          <br><br>
                          The Mahabharata and Ramayana are often looked at as linear texts written by one author in a particular period. The stories have actually been passed on   over   a   few   centuries   and   have   several   authors,interpolations   and versions. A ‘monolithic’   view   of   these   texts   diminishes   their   depth   and unimaginable   richness.   The   Ramayana   alone   has   300   versions!   The   oral versions   of   the   epics   are   illustrated   by   the   puppet   performances.   The performing arts are a major vessel to carry these repositories of wisdom. To cite a simple example, in the written versions of the Ramayana we mostly hear of one Ravana or the ten headed king of Lanka but in the oral narrative we hear of six different Ravanas, Dash-Kantha- the ten headed, Shata-kantha the   hundred   headed   Ravanas,   Mahi-Ravana   and   Ahi   Ravana,   the   two brothers, Chayya Ravana and Maya Ravana as holograms of the ten headed Ravana. Even the story  of  the most commonly  known  ten  headed Ravana has different back stories in each version.
                          <br><br>
                          The   Southern   states   namely   Kerala,   Karnataka,   Tamil   Nadu   and   Andhra Pradesh   and   the   Eastern   state   of   Orissa   have   their   own   distinct   type   of shadow   puppetry.   The   four   Southern   states   can   trace   their   roots   to   the shadow puppet form (Chamrachiye Bahuliye) of Maharashtra in the West of India,  now a rarely  seen form.  It  is  believed  that  the puppeteers  travelled from   coastal   Maharashtra   to   Karnataka   and   then   to   Tamil   Nadu.   This   is apparent   from   the   common   language   “Arre”,   an   old   version   of   Marathi spoken by the puppeteers of all these states even today. About a thousand years ago, the Maharaja of Palghat, a kingdom (now a district in the state of Kerala)   invited   scholars   who   were   experts   of   the   Kamba   Ramayana   from Tamilnadu   to   come   to   Kerala   and   set   up   puppet   theaters   outside   the Bhadrakali   temples   across   Palghat.   Even   today   during   the   Bhadrakali festivals,   the   Pullavars,   or   puppeteer/scholars   perform   inside   the “Kootamadams” puppet theaters built across the temples’ sanctum sanctora. Eighty   three   such   theaters   come   alive   from   February   to   May   every   year, where episodes from the Kamba Ramayana are performed over 7, 11, 14, 21 or 64 nights from sun set to sun rise. Fire from the goddesses’ sanctum is used   to   light   the   lamps   of   the   puppet   theater.   In   the   Kamba   Ramayana version, Ravana is not the villain but the cursed door keeper of Vaikuntham, who is reborn as Ravana with his brother Kumbhakarna, only to be released by the Avatar of Vishnu, Ram.
                          <br><br>
                          Karnataka-   Togalu   Gombeyata   –   The   shadows   have   vibrant   colors, traditionally   these   were   black,   red   and   white.   These   have   three   kinds   of puppets   within   the   shadow   form.   The   composite   image   puppets   (Jamgat Bavli) where one image tells a whole story or a series of images tell a story like in a comic book. The single image/character puppet (Ikpat Bavli) which does   not   have   any   articulation   and   the   single   character   with   joints   for articulation   (Haathpheruthali   Bavli).   The   puppeteers   belong   to   the Sillakayata   community,   originally   a   hunting-gathering   tribe   that   made   and performed   with   leather   shadow   puppets.   In   their   stories   they   appear   as “Sillakayata” the clown and trace their mythical origins as the royal guards of   Rama.  The   story  goes  that  Surpanakha,  the   sister  of  the  defeated  king Ravana, comes to Sita in disguise, begging her to engage her as a ladies’ maid.   Sita,   engages   her   and   in   time   she   becomes   close   to   the   queen   by telling her stories. One day she asks Sita, if she remembers Ravana, and Sita tells her that she had never seen Ravana. Surpanakha, keeps persisting “O queen,you must have seen him sometime?”, “Didn’t he visit you everyday?”, “How could you have never seen him”, so Sita succumbs and says that she has once seen his toe. On Surpanakha’s insistence Sita draws this toe from memory   onto   a   large   piece   of   paper.   Surpanakha,   an   experienced enchantress, then draws the rest of the figure of her brother and brings it to life.   This   was/is   Chhaya   Ravana,   a   shadow   Ravana,   bent   on   avenging   his death. He thus hides under the bed. When Ram returns to his bedchamber to rest, he pops out to avenge himself but the guards fight and defeat him. He is then cut up in small parts and strung together as a puppet. Thus are born shadow puppets.
                          <br><br>
                          In Tamil Nadu, the opaque shadow puppet, called Thol Bommalata, becomes bigger and more colourful. ‘Thol’ is shadow and ‘Bomba’ or ‘Gomba’ is a doll and   ‘latam’   is   dance,   so   literally   translated,   it   is   shadow-doll-dance.   The puppets   are   usually   individual   characters   and   one   puppeteer   plays   all   the puppets by changing voices for all the characters, sings and plays several instruments. Sometimes a harmonium  player also assists him and he may have an assistant to hand him the puppets. The average show has more than two puppets on stage at a time so quick changes characterize the shows. Animal characters and numerous jesters keep the shows very contemporary and fun.
                          <br><br>
                          Tolu   Bommalatam,   Andhra   Pradesh,   look   similar   to   their   Tamil   cousins, except   they   are   the   largest   shadow   puppets   in   the   family.   Lankini,   the demoness guarding the island of Lanka can be four meters!! Most puppets are   between   1.5-2.5   meters   and   one   puppeteer   plays   one   character   at   a time. The puppets have many articulations and so the legs, arms, head and sometimes even the waist moves. Backstage, balanced on a wooden plank, the   puppeteer   dances   along   with   his   puppet,   setting   the   rhythm   and enabling the puppet’s legs to move without actually touching them. In this version based on the Molla, Kamba and Adbhuta Ramayana,one can hear the story   of   Ahi-Ravana   and   Mahi-Ravana   ,   two   brothers   and   childhood classmates of the king of Lanka. He tricks them into joining the war against Ram. They kidnap Ram and Lakshman and Hanuman must follow them to the nether world to rescue them.
                          <br><br>
                          The Ravanchayya, of Orissa, like Kerala, has black and white puppets only. These   are   small   puppets   and   use   tricks   like   small   versions   of   the   same character to show long distance and large version to show nearness. This is based on the Bichitra Ramayana written by Bishwanath Khuntia for theatrical performances.
                          <br><br>
                          I hope that in the near future we will see more acknowledgment to this art- form in India. Training opportunities, that trains both, generational puppeteers from families that practice traditional forms and new artists from a non traditional background to be skilled professionals in the arts of puppetry. Exposures for audiences besides the traditional audience might snowball into a deeper questioning of the stereotypes that surround the art form. Maybe this will increase the self-esteem of the puppeteer and encourage the children of generational puppeteers to continue to practice their art and also be free to innovate. With projects like this virtual library maybe finally, the “dying art” label will be challenged by an increased digital presence of Indian traditional puppet theatre. And maybe it will finally bring in it’s wake policy changes. But it is definite that this will lead to new discourses around puppet theatre and a strong stimulus for innovation in all puppet theatre in India.

                          <br><br>
                          Welcome to The Library of Elements: a VR experience devoted to European medieval alchemy. There is no simple definition of alchemy, which, in different forms, has developed independently in India, China, the Arab world, and Europe. At its most basic level, alchemy is an art form and practice devoted to nature and transformation. Its roots are pre-literate; its body of knowledge is transmitted in symbols, dreams, rituals, and, later codexes.
                          <br><br>
                          The difficulty in approaching alchemy today is that it clashes with the contemporary scientific worldview, which assumes matter and the cosmos to be dead. For most of human history, matter and the cosmos were believed to be living things. The practices of mining raw ores and the art of their transformation into metals, an act known as metallurgy, were considered sacred acts. But we now take metals and their meanings for granted. For example, it is doubtful you believe your cell phone, composed of copper, tellurium, lithium, cobalt, manganese, and tungsten, to be a sacred device connected to the planet and its history. Nor do you believe my library, which depends on the internet, with its hundreds of millions of kilometers of metal cables, stretched across oceans and continents, to be a divine manifestation.
                          <br><br>
                          The medieval alchemist thought differently. To use fire to transmute raw ores into purified metals was considered a reenactment of the progress of the cosmos, from primordial chaos into higher forms of consciousness. By pursuing the perfection of these metals, the alchemist pursued his own perfection. The liberation of those metals from base stone was seen as akin to the alchemist's own spiritual liberation. Freedom, illumination, even immortality was believed possible since to transmute metals was to collaborate with the creator and free matter from the laws of time. This total transformation, of both the material and spiritual worlds, was titled The Great Work.
                          <br><br>

                          The Tradition of Alchemy and Creative Imagination
                        </h2>
                        <br>
                        <p class="colorGreyGreen">
                          Alchemy, otherwise known as “the science of music”, “the gay science”, or “the celestial gardening”, is a word shrouded in a veil of mystery that promises initiation into forgotten mysteries. Historically, alchemy dates back to the mysteries of early metallurgists, sacred Egyptian temple teachings, Greek-Alexandrian hermeticism, and Byzantine and Arabic alchemical practices (the science of balance). As a tradition, alchemy is most familiar to us in the form associated with Christianity, for example, the teachings of the Rosicrucians. Less known to Westerners are the equally developed and still unbroken traditions of Chinese and Indian alchemies. For the practitioner, who may have little or no interest in these separate histories,  alchemy is a spiritual and transformative teaching whose goal is the “philosopher’s stone”: a remedy (whether in the form of powder, tincture, edible vermilion, drinkable gold, or spagyric quintessence) or transformation of consciousness whose effect is not limited to the body, but extends to the soul and spirit, manifesting itself in all the natural realms, from minerals to humans. In other words, the alchemical quest corresponds to a state of body, mind, and spirit which seeks harmony between the human soul and the soul of the world.
                          <br><br>
                          What distinguishes alchemy from purely mystical or “spiritual” paths is above all the loving work, or practice, with substances, matter, materials (particularly with metals), since matter – through all the ways in which it can be refined, perfected, and revitalized -- reflects the inner growth of the laboring alchemist and, in turn, has a retroactive effect on him. This means that by changing matter, or metals, in particular, the alchemist has the power to change him or herself. Why metals? According to alchemical cosmology, the lowest form of matter in the golden chain, or hierarchy, of creation corresponds to the highest form of matter; and even while metals correspond to the lowest level, they also embody the greatest potency and healing power. The prerequisite for this dialectical interplay of substance and spirit lies within the alchemist themself.  It relates to their  “inner chymic wedding” at the “heart of the heart”, which is the way in which their inner self or spirit affects their work. This is also referred to as the intersection of the cross, whose horizontal axis manifests two contrary poles (male and female, animus and anima), and whose vertical axis is the medium of divine influence on the world. The inner union of the “male and female principle” is thus the sacrifice of one’s own ego to the divine Spirit, the mysterious passage through death, and the transformation of limited consciousness and its preparation for enlightenment. This transformation, if achieved, can also be understood as the marriage of substance and Spirit.
                          <br><br>
                          The unity of spirit and body – or of divine and material principles – emphasized by alchemists, is perhaps even more important to alchemy than the Aristotelian notion of the transformation of elemental qualities, which can be best understood as the transmutation of metals.  Mythically, this transformation echoes a much older, archaic concept, which conceived of metals as organic, living things that ripened in the womb of the Earth. According to Stoic teachings, God equals substance, in other words, “God is a quality inseparable from substance and passes through it as the seed passes through genitals.” While in their power or force, the two principles of spirit and body (active and passive, God and substance, or Sulphur and Mercury) are understood as the cosmos, manifested, they are at the same time inseparably connected. In this way, they form a unity. This unity in alchemy is symbolized by the rebis (“doublet”): the hermaphrodite of the alchemical Great Work.
                          <br><br>
                          Since Hellenistic alchemy, the traditional process mentioned above has been carried out in three basic phases. These, in turn, are symbolized by three colors: the phase of putrefaction and decomposition of the substance into primordial matter (black or nigredo), the phase of purification of the body (white work or albedo), and the final phase of the red work (rubedo), which represents the attainment of the royal philosophical stone, which equals the entire transformation of one’s mind, body, and spirit.
                          <br><br>
                          A person unfamiliar with alchemy will certainly be impressed by the wide array of diverse imagery associated with it. As a knowledge system, alchemy speaks in the form of images, stories, fairy tales, dreams, and visions. Thanks to the Christian world’s trust in the power and efficacy of images, the mythological bedrock of “paganism”, which we see visualized in alchemy, not only continued but thrived, albeit with meanings that flourished.  In esoteric Christianity, this very trust in images even provided a counterpoint to iconoclastic tendencies within modern science which emerged from one conceptual version of Christianity that emphasized detachment, inaccessibility, and transcendence of the hidden God.
                          <br><br>
                          Historically, while alchemy assumes an interconnection between the two fundamental dimensions of the world – heavenly/divine and earthly/ephemeral - it struggled as a philosophy to be accepted because of the ways in which it conflicted with ideas upheld by the mainstream Chirstian Church. For example, within alchemy, this connection between the spirit and body is understood as an incarnation of the divine. This is in direct contradiction to the dualistic tendencies which gave birth to the disembodied perspective of modern science, we can see the birthright of Western materialism. God, when thought of as pure spirit, who is fully Himself and nothing else, and to whom one can relate only and exclusively by faith and not by cognitive powers of any kind, in this way, became the forerunner of the “modern abstract conception of objective reality.”
                          <br><br>
                          In the eminently hermetic art of alchemy, which is focused on the ancient and occult traditions, the mediating role of the planet Mercury is central. Mercury is the guide of souls and a messenger of the gods: a mutable or flexible principle whose domain is the imagination. In this role, Mercury is understood as the mediator between the world of phenomena, which is accessible to the senses, and the world of angelic intelligence, which is otherworldly and only reachable by a higher sense. Like a meditator, the alchemist enters the world of alchemical visionary reality by moving within him or herself to a space where all that is external becomes internal.
                          <br><br>
                          Yet the imagined world, or world of the imagination, is not a Jungian collective unconscious: a term introduced by Carl Jung that represents the unconscious as a space or thing that contains memories and impulses common to all human beings and part of our internal brain structure. In the case of the alchemical imagination, the images are not given to everyone in the same way. On the contrary: that world is always personal and unique. It is not purely material. Nor is it wholly immaterial, or intellectual in character. The alchemical imagination has its own unique dimension and space which Henry Corbin calls “imaginal” and is described as a world of “subtle bodies” or “suspended images”. Within that world, the imagination’s main role is that of mediating between gross matter and the spirit. Furthermore, it is this feature of the alchemical imagination, through which this world emerges and becomes known, that makes it possible to transform the spiritual world into the phenomenal or material world and to ensure their mutual communication. This cognitive function of the imagination enables an act of thinking that avoids banal rationalism. This is because this spiritual exchange between the outer and inner world is in contradiction to any form of reductive rationalism which oscillates in vain between “matter” and “spirit” while facing an unsolvable dilemma, which is that history and myth cannot be separated. This includes the myth of rationalism and Western Materialism.
                          <br><br>
                          In alchemy, it is precisely this acknowledgment of the imagination and its corresponding connection to the spiritual world that sets it apart from other knowledge systems. In this case, the imagined world has a metaphysical reality. It is a thing that exists. This is why it plays a crucial role in our world. It is a mediator and one that validates those who commit themselves to spiritual narratives, which is why reports on “events in Heaven” can be taken seriously. The same is true about the validity of dreams, symbolic rituals, and the reality of places that are shaped by the imagination, especially those that inspire visions, cosmogonies, and theogonies. Finally, the truth and meaning which grow out of the connections between the spiritual world and the imagination are where prophetic revelations come from, which is to say prophecy itself depends on this connection.
                          <br><br>
                          In western culture, the theophanic vision, which is the idea that one can personally encounter God in an observable or sensible way, faded away after the era of Paracelsus, a German-Swiss alchemist, and physician of the 16th century. From that time on, the scientific worldview and the subsequent mathematization and “mechanization” of cosmology took over, as did the transference of the soul to a psychological state. Other conceptions of the soul and God would come from Eastern theosophy, which developed the idea of the “creative imagination” which teaches us how to recognize the hidden meaning in the manifest forms. In other words, in the West, the soul and God ceased to exist as objective, observable, and sensible phenomena.
                          <br><br>
                          In alchemy, the experience of the soul taking the form of the body and the body being the image of the soul would later manifest in initiatory narratives that included the acquisition of “physiognomic” knowledge, an idea or practice which believes that you can access a person’s personality (or to learn the inner quality of the plant or other substance) through their outer appearance. Within alchemical and hermetic traditions, this practice of insight, which unmasks reality, so as to make the invisible visible, is identified with Angelic knowledge. It is otherwise known as the Journey to the Angel. “In order to embark on the pilgrimage of knowledge at all, one needs a guide, whom the tradition calls the inner master, the perfect Nature, the Witness, or the Angel Gabriel, or the active Intellect, who will help one to master the three fickle companions of the soul: desire, anger, and false imagination, and will help the pilgrim to an ontological metamorphosis that will create a subtle and immortal body that alone is capable of penetrating the imaginal world. On the ethical level, this means that “the neurotic desire for any object associated with desire must be reoriented into a desire for the Beautiful. The appetite for sensual pleasures must be moved while striving for the dream of heaven, and the wrath of impulsive emotions, is to be transformed into the courage to wage that ʻgreat warʼ against oneself rather than to fight little wars against others.”
                          <br><br>
                          Pierre-Yves Albrecht aptly describes the archetypal thresholds, or doorways to this experience, as a passage through an initiatory form of death which finds its equivalents in each of the genuine spiritual traditions whose authenticity is attested to by their ability to overcome the psychic-bodily conditioning of the personal self. After the passage through the darkness, which corresponds to the dark night of the soul, the pilgrim awaits the passage through the elements, the aim of which is to get to know the composition of the self as “consciousness-body”. He or she then passes through the various mansions, or levels of reality, that previously enslaved him.
                          <br><br>
                          “The substance one encounters mostly on the surface is that with which the ordinary self is constantly identified: the psyche, the ordinary reflexive dynamic mechanisms. When the soul recognizes and masters them, it is blessed by ‘omnipresent and pervading’ virtue that can directly influence other spirits, the ability to read minds, and to evoke certain images in other minds. A new phenomenon emerges: it is no longer dominated by “cerebral” reflection, but by the emergence of profound and radical idea-energies, perceived directly, as it were, without the ubiquitous filter of judgment and reasoning. Subsequently, the exploration ventures into the deeper layers of being, towards the seat of global affectivity where the influences of the primordial energies associated with animality are manifest and of which the external animal species are but a relative opening for the senses. The soul recognizes its animal world and its “sacred animals,” its totems and zodiacal faculties, the roots of the bestiary that continually return the emotional currents to their sources. As the immersion deepens, the soul begins to touch the subtle forces which correspond to the plant kingdom. This is a uniquely shamanic plane, which opens the way to a “supersensory” perception of plant essences associated with corresponding abilities. The soul acquires knowledge of magical medicine associated with the wisdom of plants, i.e., direct knowledge of the appropriate medicines, the “signatures” or spirits of herbs capable of acting with incredible efficiency on diseases of the body, heart, and spirit. The final stage is reached when the descent into the depths reaches the telluric structure of the body and when the soul recognizes the minerality and the “atomic and molecular” networks of its being. It gains thus the power to act upon substances and upon the “laws of external minerality,” always in accordance with the homology according to which he who has been able to transform his own metals within himself can now effect such a transformation externally. Each step of the descent into the inwardness of existence takes place under the patronage of a certain category of Angel-energies. The Cherubim, for example, govern the plane of the mineral kingdom. In the narrative, the climate of the Elements and Species follows that of the Earthly and Celestial Substances. Let us bear in mind that reality is structured according to two principles: the Substance and the Form (Idea).”
                          <br><br>
                          Yves-Albrecht further compares the liberation of these virtual energies extracted from the Shadow, or the dark part of the soul, to finding a bride hidden in the very heart, which in the Christian hermetic tradition corresponds to the encounter with the celestial goddess or archetype Sophia. Then, according to the Christina mystic Gichtel, the soul itself becomes an angel of God who inhabits the heavens and speaks with God. Initiation is thus accomplished through cardiognosis: the traditional “thinking of the heart.” From the point of Christian Hermeticism, this heart-based knowledge cannot be acquired by any external or internal technical procedure; the grace of God cannot be “earned”, it cannot be the object of any effort; one does not initiate oneself, one becomes initiated.
                          <br><br>
                          The acquisition of this “quintessence” is at the same time “the middle way”, the way of balance and tempering, which makes possible the action of what has been called the “third force”, or the efficacy of divine grace. Alchemically speaking, this “sharing” of initiation is only possible as consciousness extends simultaneously in both directions, along the Sun-Heart-Gold axis.
                          <br><br>
                          As a knowledge system, alchemy returns to us the abandoned and seemingly outmoded motifs and themes that were central to Hermetic thought, in particular, the role of imagination as the bond that ensures the inner interconnectedness of the world, the way of thinking in analogies, the relationship between the macrocosm and the microcosm, and the concept of man as the keystone of the universe and the image of God, not only as the ruler or subjugator of nature, but especially as the one who, by his very being in the world, orders the world in a certain way: his responsibility for himself is also his responsibility for the world, and vice versa.

                          Welcome to The Library of Navigation, a VR experience devoted to Polynesian navigation, a knowledge system developed by the seagoing people who colonized the largest ocean in the world, beginning 3,000 years ago. By developing tools and skills that allowed them to read the sun, stars, winds, clouds, birds, fish, and seas, and using oral traditions that encoded and passed on their knowledge, the Polynesians were able to settle every habitable island in the mid-Pacific. This VR piece celebrates this achievement, one equal to the first flights into space or the major inventions of the Industrial Revolution.
                          <br><br>
                          It is hard to imagine what navigation meant to your ancestors. This is partly because over half of all humans now carry in their pockets a computer that is millions of times more powerful than the one that first landed humans on the moon. With a smartphone, a person with no navigational skills can now find their way anywhere in the world with a wireless signal. At no other point in history was this imaginable. Instead, traveling over a mountain range, a desert, or a large body of water would have been the project not of a year or even a lifetime but of generations—sometimes tens of generations.
                          <br><br>
                          How did early humans accomplish these extraordinary migrations? The first Westerners to arrive in Polynesia struggled to understand how a people without maps, compasses, writing, or metal tools could settle an area that extended over 40 million square kilometers of blue ocean. They proposed many different theories, often failing to understand that the Polynesian peoples’ achievements were not due to chance, or luck, but to their ability to store and pass on knowledge about navigation and survival through a highly developed and complex storytelling tradition, which included poems, songs, chants, dances, and more. Thanks to scientists, folklorists, and Polynesians who preserved their traditional stories, this knowledge system lives on.
                          <br><br>
                          Enter The Library of Navigation and listen to a morning prayer and chant, in Hawaiian; sail in the outrigger canoe and learn to tell the difference between the animals in your boat and those that might guide you. To learn more about this library, listen to the podcasts with Christina Thompson and Hawaiian chanter Kuuleilani Reyes or read the essay by Thompson, The Infinite Library’s expert on the history of Polynesian navigation.

                          If we were to cast our minds back a few thousand years and look at the distribution of humans across the globe, we might notice something interesting about where they lived. We would find people living in the deepest jungles, in the most arid deserts, and way up in the highest mountains in the world; we would even find them living on the ice. By 2000 BCE, humans had figured out how to inhabit almost all of Earth’s environments, even the most geographically challenging. But there was still one type of place they not been able to reach.
                          <br><br>
                          Out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, thousands of miles from any continental edge, lie hundreds of little islands. The vast majority of these are found in the tropical and semi-tropical zones; they are warm, well-watered, covered with plants, and surrounded by seas full of life. They are in many ways ideal from the point of view of humans seeking a place to live. And yet, until about 3500 years ago, no one had ever set foot on them. The vast stretches of ocean that separate them from the continents presented an insurmountable barrier—until someone figured out to how to cross these great expanses of sea.
                          <br><br>
                          Even within the history of human achievement, this was an astonishing feat. Over a period of perhaps 1500 years—from roughly 500 BCE to 1000 CE—a migratory, ocean-going people, traveling in open canoes and navigating without compasses or maps, explored and colonized the entire Pacific, settling for the first time in human history some of the remotest and most isolated islands in the world.
                          <br><br>
                          Today we refer to the area at the center of this story as Polynesia: a triangular region of some 25 million square kilometers bounded by the islands of Hawai‘i, Easter Island (Rapa Nui), and New Zealand (Aotearoa), and encompassing the archipelagoes of Tahiti, Tonga, Samoa, and many more. The Islanders who inhabit this region, and who go by various names including Māori (Aotearoa New Zealand), Kānaka Maoli (Hawai’i), and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) are all descended from a group of Austronesian seafarers who left the Asian mainland perhaps 5000 years ago. Gradually working their way south from Taiwan, through the Philippines and Indonesia, around the north coast of Papua New Guinea, and past the Solomon Islands to Vanuatu and New Caledonia, they emerged from the region known as Island Southeast Asia into the vast and largely empty territory of Remote Oceania. By 500 BCE they had reached Tonga and Samoa; by perhaps 800 CE they had discovered the islands of the mid-Pacific: Tahiti, Rarotonga, the Marquesas. And somewhere around the 1000 CE mark they made the epic voyages that took them to the farthest points of the Polynesian triangle.
                          <br><br>
                          Travelling in large, double-hulled canoe, they carried with them everything they needed to make a new life in a new land. They brought animals like dogs, pigs, and chickens; food plants like breadfruit, kumara, and taro. They brought coconuts, of course, that most useful of crops—a tree that gives food, drink, shelter, cordage, storage, and so much more—and cuttings of trees like the paper mulberry, from whose bark they made cloth. They brought their gods, their customs, and their languages, and in each of the islands they discovered they remade a version of their world.

                          Sometimes they named the new lands they discovered in memory of places they had left: Upolu, Vava‘u, and especially Hawaiki, a mythic homeland commemorated in many Polynesian archipelagoes, including most obviously that of Hawai‘i. They brought a way of thinking predicated on the importance of descent. Everything, in their cosmology, was linked genealogically: not just gods and people, but sand and stones, rocks and trees, creeping and swimming and flying things, all the animate and inanimate matter of the world. They were acute, perspicacious, intimate observers of their universe: a world of sea and sky and islands, of oceanic weather patterns and tropical and subtropical seasons. It was a world their ancestors had inhabited for millennia, and they were masters of its complexity.
                          <br><br>
                          For many hundreds of years these Islanders were the only humans of this part of the world. But in the early sixteenth century another group of voyagers arrived. Europeans, first the Spanish and the Portuguese, followed in the seventeenth century by the Dutch, gradually began to work their way around the great ocean. They quickly discovered that the Pacific was much larger than they had expected and that it contained a great deal less land. They were laboring under a misconception about the existence of a continent somewhere in the southern reaches of the Pacific basin. But while they searched in vain for this imaginary landmass, their quest for it did eventually lead them to the islands.
                          <br><br>
                          European explorers in the Pacific were further surprised to discover that every island in the mid-Pacific that could sustain a human population—as well as many that seemed only marginally capable of supporting human life—was inhabited. Where, they wondered, had these large, thriving, well-established populations come from? And how, given the intrinsic difficulty of crossing such an enormous ocean, had they managed to get there?
                          <br><br>
                          By then, enough time had elapsed since the original settlement of the islands that much about this chapter of human history was beginning to drift into obscurity. At some point in the distant past—no one knows exactly when—Polynesians had stopped making the very longest journeys across their watery domain. They still travelled distances of some hundreds of kilometers among contiguous archipelagoes (within the Fiji–Tonga–Samoa region, for example), but truly long-distance voyaging, the 3000- and 4000-kilometre journeys that had originally taken them out to the farthest reaches of the Polynesian triangle, had become a thing of the past.
                          <br><br>
                          The Islanders still had stories of these epic voyages, however, tales of heroic navigators who braved the dangers of the deep and who set out on quests to discover new islands, or procure objects of value, or make daring rescues, or sometimes simply to escape difficulties at home. Such narratives, which we might classify as myths, have a lot to say about the experience and worldview of oceanic peoples, their relationships to sea creatures, their knowledge of islands, their awareness of the dangers and challenges of a life lived on the sea, even about the motivations of those who undertook such incredible journeys. And they sometimes contain surprisingly detailed information about practical matters like the ideal size of a crew, or the foods to be taken on a journey, or even the precise geography of a particular archipelago.
                          <br><br>
                          There are interesting differences between the way that information is transmitted in an oral culture, like that of the voyagers who settled these islands, and cultures like our own which rely largely on writing. In an oral culture, all information is passed by word of mouth, and this not only constrains the kinds of information that can be communicated, it alters the shape that information takes. In our digital world, for example, any geographic knowledge that we might need is likely encoded in GPS and accessed through an electronic device. European navigators of three hundred years ago relied on maps and charts and others forms of written documentation, as well as mechanical devices like compasses and quadrants. Polynesian voyagers of five hundred years ago obviously did not have GPS, but they also did not use maps or compasses. Their geographic knowledge was encoded in stories and chants.
                          <br><br>
                          A famous story still told in Hawai‘i concerns the goddess Pele, who set out from her distant homeland on a journey. At length, she reached the Hawaiian Islands, arriving first at the island of Ni‘ihau, which is the most northwesterly island in the chain. Traveling in southeasterly direction, she passed on to Kauai, then to O‘ahu, and on to each island in turn, naming each in the correct geographical order, until she finally arrived at the Big Island of Hawai‘i, the most southeasterly of them all. The story is in some sense the oral equivalent of a map. But there are many such narratives; a chant from the Caroline Islands similarly enumerates a sequence of islands in geographical order, as it describes the movements of a parrotfish flitting from one to the next in an effort to avoid being caught.
                          <br><br>
                          Such chants were not just directions. They often had additional dimensions, doubling as invocations to the gods, as spiritual as well as geographic aids to navigation, or even as morality tales, involving information about the correct protocols to be observed when building or launching a canoe or traveling to a distant place. And it is undoubtedly these other dimensions that helped keep them alive in the culture for so many hundreds of years. But there is another kind of voyaging knowledge—specific, practical, technical information about how to set a course, or fix a position at sea, or find land when it is below the horizon, the kind of hands-on information that a practitioner might pass along to an apprentice—that either could not be easily encoded in narratives or chants, or that simply fell out of use as the demand for it diminished. And this almost did disappear.
                          <br><br>
                          What saved it was a decision by a group of sailors, anthropologists, and cultural revivalists in Hawai‘i in the 1960s and ’70s to try to recreate one of the great long-distance voyages of the past. They wanted to know how it had been done, and so they simply decided to try and do it. They built a replica voyaging canoe (or vaka) called Hokule‘a, and, with the help of a Micronesian navigator named Mau Piailug, they sailed it using only traditional, non-instrumental navigational methods from Hawai‘i to Tahiti.
                          <br><br>
                          This voyage, now the stuff of legend, involved a fascinating suite of techniques which were then still in use by only a tiny number of master navigators outside of Polynesia in the Caroline and other islands. In order to maintain a heading, they followed what is known as a star path, a predetermined series of stars rising in sequence near a particular point on the horizon. They paid attention to ocean swells and wave patterns, observing how the ocean interacted with the land. They noted the formations of clouds, which behave differently over land and water, and the behavior of birds, who go out to feed in the morning and return to their islands at night. They used a method of position-fixing which required the navigator to hold an imaginary island in his mind and keep track of where he was in relation to it. All this was done without any kind of record-keeping in the form or notes or maps and without any navigational devices. It was an entirely mental process and one that relied almost solely upon the capacity of the navigator.
                          <br><br>
                          The success of this voyage and the many that followed represents an extraordinary instance of the reclamation of knowledge. All around the Pacific, the art of wayfinding—the modern version of an ancient practice—is now being disseminated as part of a widespread cultural revival in the wake of two centuries of colonialism. Vaka, or voyaging canoes, from around the Pacific have not only reconnected the islands of Polynesia, they have gone farther, sailing right around the world. A creative blend of old and new, the Polynesian voyaging movement reflects the radical potential of knowledge to inspire us, even as it evolves and changes with time.

                  Visitors to the main cavern have a stick, which allows them to draw in the sand, activate the cosmic pools, and portal into the realms. Other items, partially hidden, must be discovered. For example, a large turtle who lurks in the shadows and a Neanderthal flute, carved from the bone of a bear around 50,000 years ago.

                  Why a cave?
                  <br><br>
                  Caves are where we find the first forms of symbolic expression, beginning around 70,000 years ago. They were our first libraries - spaces where our cultures incubated. But as humans mastered agriculture, around 10,000 years ago, our tool making abilities rapidly accelerated. We created cities, invented written languages, mastered navigation, launched an industrial revolution, and sent people and later tens of thousands of satellites into space. In geological time, this all happened in less than a second. Were the planet’s history a 24-hour clock, we arrived at 11:59:40. And yet, in just a few hundred years, a nanosecond, our species has fundamentally changed the planet’s geochemical makeup. One result is that we have triggered the sixth mass extinction, which is under-way.
                  <br><br>
                  While the cave and its cosmic pools are symbolic portals, intended to glorify our planet’s evolution, they are also reminders, even warnings, that our human story is impossibly young; and very fragile. The Infinite Library’s main cavern invites us to return to and reflect upon our species’ beginnings. It also poses the question: what will the next phase of our planet’s evolution look like? By inviting visitors into the first library created around the concept of deep time, The Infinite Library seeks to pose more questions than answers. Symbolized by the ouroboros, the snake that eats its tail, it asks us to reimagine the library not as a thing, or specific form, but as a living idea, and one that must die to be reborn.

        <p>
          This installation seeks to share stories that are living, tactile, and nonlinear. In the VR spaces, this translates to simulated environments that host embedded knowledge, which is multisensory and unique to each visitor. The physical installation presents the context behind these virtual spaces. Click on the link below to move through the User Journey.

                  Visitors first approach a monitor, outside the main installation space, where The Infinite Library introduces itself in first person. There they also receive a pair of headphones and are instructed, via a QR code, as to how they can begin their journey into the installation. Those who do not have a smartphone will be provided with a smart tablet.
                  <br><br>
                  When visitors first scan the QR code at the entry, they will have two options. They can either EXPLORE the library's house (the installation) or they can PLAY A GAME with the library.
                  <br><br>
                  THE VOLUMES
                  <br><br>
                  Within the installation, visitors can click on QR codes, affixed to jars, to hear the library narrate stories about the contents within. We call this section The Volumes. Detailed, 3D sculptures, resting in sand, represent 8 stages of evolution, spanning the birth of the planet up until the origin of the hominids. Each sculpture is accompanied by short audio or texts accessible via the QR codes. The goal of these interactions is to introduce processes and organisms which are featured inside animated cosmic pools within the main cavern of the VR space. If in GAME mode, the library will interact with the visitors,  giving hints so that each player can follow a story which is linear, through time. If in EXPLORE mode the visitor's  User Journey is entirely up to them.
                  <br><br>
                  PROJECTIONS
                  <br><br>
                  Beyond The Volumes, the installation space doubles as a place to make discoveries and learn more about The Realms. Three projections will feature the symbols for these libraries. Near each projection visitors can scan a QR code that will summarize the story behind each respective Realm. Those wanting to learn more can also click on a link, within the QR code experience, which will lead them to The Infinite Library’s website, where scholarly essays, documentary images, and podcasts can be found.

                  Sofia-Tamara Shmidt alias AWALI is a Ukrainian-Polish singer, producer, and composer. She studied classical piano, singing, and choral conducting but made her mark in the Czech electronic music scene. Her music is an ethereal mixture of soft vocals, synthesisers, and musical experiments in the form of melancholic downtempo and dark pop-ambient. Her self-made visuals, music, mixing, sound design, and lyrics allows her to challenge boundaries between emotions. Her compositions are imaginative and poetic expressions of the finest nuances of feelings through the prism of sound.
